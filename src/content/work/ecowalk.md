# CONTEXT

## Background

Ecowalk is a mobile app inspired by the question: **_how does my choice of transportation impact the environment?_** EcoWalk encourages people make environmentally conscious decisions through healthy activities.

## Team & Objective

As part of Dandilyonn's 2021 SEEDS internship cohort, I worked with an iOS team of two other developer interns, Stephanie and Remi. Each team was assigned the task of developing an app that aligned with Dandilyonn’s mission to raise environmental awareness by addressing a specific sector that contributes to climate change.

## Problem

### <i class="fa-solid fa-forward-fast"></i> The hidden cost of convenience.

Many people prioritize convenience in their daily tasks. Whether it's reaching a destination or something as simple as turning on the lights, they often overlook the environmental impact of their actions, focusing instead on what is easy and efficient.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i> Convenience is impacting both health and the climate.

America is grappling with a widespread obesity epidemic. With the growing availability of fast and convenient options, from food to transportation, people have become increasingly sedentary and demand instant gratification in their daily tasks. This shift is not only harming their health but also intensifying climate change.

> How can we combat the threat of climate change with the benefits of physical activity?

## Opportunity

In many American cities, relying on cars for travel is often unavoidable and an essential part of people’s daily routines. This raises an important question: **how can we foster new, positive habits through our transportation choices?** To address this challenge effectively, we needed to delve deeper into people's needs and frustrations with their current transportation options.

# RESEARCH

## Guiding Principles

Creating a walking-first application wasn't our initial choice. My team and I explored various environmental issues - food waste, deforestation, water pollution - and the challenges posed by daily human activities before settling on EcoWalk. Our decision was guided by the following key principles:

## Contextual Inquiry

My next focus was to gather perspectives on transportation needs from those around me. I reached out to my local community to understand how their daily routines are impacted by transportation. Additionally, with the help of my team members, I extended this outreach to major cities beyond Los Angeles to collect a wide range of insights.

## Empathy Mapping

Given the responses of 60+ interviewees, I used an empathy map to distinguish frustration patterns. This approach revealed several key points of frustration: **_convenience, time, and personal motivation_**.

With these new insights, my team and I ultimately decided on EcoWalk, with the mission to accomplish the following goals.

## Goals

### <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i> Embrace one less convenient activity daily.

We understand that daily tasks often require convenience, but **_some activities can be approached with less urgency_**. By choosing to forgo one convenience-driven habit each day, people can make small and meaningful contributions to the environment.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-shoe-prints"></i> Commit to practicing a healthy habit weekly.

By setting incremental goals to incorporate a healthy habit into your routine, starting with just one day a week, you can gradually make it a regular part of your life.

# DESIGN PROCESS

## Style Guide

To kick off the design process, I crafted a UI style guide to maintain consistent styling across the app. Embracing a modern and unconventional approach to environmentalism, I used shades of blue and green to create a design that is both sleek and serious, yet engaging and playful.

## Flow Chart

My team and I mapped out a simple user flow. This served as a guide for us to refer back to during design iterations and for ideating new, creative solutions to problems we encountered during usability testing.

## Wireframes

### Low-Fi Wireframes

Our first priority was to quickly create low-fidelity mockups of the core features. With only two months to develop the app, this step was essential for our team to grasp the application's flow and functionality.

### Hi-Fi Wireframes

Next, we developed high-fidelity wireframes to visualize how our core features aligned with our style guide, marking the beginning of our development process.

# FINAL WORK

## Onboarding

Users are initially greeted with a log in/sign in portal when opening the app. Users are also asked questions about their transportation choices to better cater Ecowalk recommendations to their needs.

## Action Board

Users can select specific activities from the planner to commit to once a week. These activities are designed to encourage walking instead of driving to short distances like grocery stores or social hangouts with friends.

## Leaderboard & Profile View

Users can view the activities that others in their community are committing to, along with their profile views. This fosters a sense of belonging, encouraging users to continue adopting healthier and eco-friendly habits inspired by the positive actions of those around them.

# IMPACT

## Outcome

At the end of the 10 weeks, my team and I presented EcoWalk to a group of engineers and technology professionals in collaboration with Dandilyonn. The idea was met with great enthusiasm, and we also received valuable feedback.

## Feedback

### <i class="fa-solid fa-map"></i> Account for the geographical constraints of the user's location.

During the ideation process, we overlooked the fact that **not everyone lives in a walkable area**, which significantly influences the reliance on cars. Dandilyonn engineers suggested that, rather than focusing solely on physical activity, we should expand the app to include other eco-friendly transportation options like scooters and trains.

## Next Steps

### <i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Incorporate feedback in the next design iterations.

Given feedback from Dandilyonn's management and engineers, I plan to incorporate this feedback into our next design iteration.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-brush"></i> Refine microinteractions and secondary features.

Given the ten week timeline of this internship, my team and I focused on Ecowalk’s core features, leaving secondary functionalities, such as activity removal, for future consideration. However, as Ecowalk’s development progresses, I plan to delve deeper into refining microinteractions and other minor features essential for maintaining user engagement with the platform.

## Reflections

### <i class="fa-solid fa-swatchbook"></i> Embrace new challenges.

During the ten weeks, our team faced an unexpected setback. Our team's designer had to leave the internship due to unforeseen circumstances, leaving us uncertain about how to handle the design work. **This marked my first exposure to UI/UX design**, and I took extra time during the internship to learn about best practices in the field. Although this wasn't how I had envisioned my summer, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and it ignited a passion that shaped the rest of my college years, driving my focus on design and tech-centered products!

### <i class="fa-solid fa-comments"></i> Communicate consistently with your team.

One challenge I encountered during this internship was effectively communicating my ideas and work to my team members. When we found ourselves facing a tight deadline midway through the internship, we made it a priority to regularly update each other on our progress in both code and design. This open communication was crucial in bringing EcoWalk to life. This experience taught me that **without consistent and clear communication, tasks can stall, and innovative ideas might never come to fruition**.
