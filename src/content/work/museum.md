## What is Museum Narratives?

**Museum Narratives** is a series of editorial pieces showcasing museum exhibits across Los Angeles. As an opinion journalist, I partnered with the **Daily Bruin**, UCLA's student-led newsletter, to write thought-provoking pieces that not only explored the exhibits but also encouraged more students to engage with and visit them.

## Mulyana's Modular Utopia

**Mulyana: Modular Utopia** is a captivating exhibit that transforms gallery spaces into immersive, otherworldly environments using intricate, hand-crocheted installations. Indonesian artist **Mulyana** crafts vibrant, modular sculptures inspired by coral reefs and marine ecosystems, blending art, sustainability, and environmental advocacy. Presented at USC's Fisher Museum of Art, Mulyana's work invites viewers to reflect on the fragility of ocean life while marveling at the beauty and intricacy of his textile creations. The exhibit is a testament to the power of art to inspire both wonder and awareness.
