# CONTEXT

## Background

[**Develop For Good (DFG)**](https://www.developforgood.org/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to bridging the digital divide in the nonprofit sector and volunteerism by providing opportunities for underserved and underrepresented college students to build real-world technical products for nonprofits.

## Problem

During DFG's Winter 2024 cycle, founder Mary Zhu initiated conversations about integrating AI into the organization’s operations to address the growing demand for AI capabilities. To meet this demand, **I focused on a critical area where AI was frequently applied: project deliverable success**. This focus was driven by an unexpected trend I identified in survey responses from the previous project cycle, Summer 2023.

## Survey Findings

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Over half of student volunteers reported using AI for DFG-related tasks for the Summer 2023 cycle.

Over 75% of student volunteers reported using AI to aid their technical development needs to meet client deliverables.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> 81% of students reported that AI significantly contributed to successful project outcomes by the end of the cycle.

Students using AI tools reported using Ai to build their problem-solving and technical skills through suggestions provided by AI.

## Define

> How can Develop For Good enhance the development experience of student volunteers by leveraging AI tools and resources?

# Research

## Student Surveys

To understand how students use AI, I analyzed weekly check-in surveys from past and present DFG cycles. By examining student responses, I aimed to assess the extent of AI usage, identify potential correlations between AI use and project outcomes, and gain insights into the factors driving student reliance on AI.

## Nonprofit Clients

I also reached out to DFG’s nonprofit clients to gather feedback on project deliverables, overall satisfaction with DFG's programs, and their perspectives on AI usage, including whether they leverage AI within their own organizations.

## Competitive Analysis

To better understand how other organizations integrate AI into their services, I looked into existing platforms that provide technical skill development for both students and non-students, similar to DFG's mission.

## Key Insights

### <i class="fa-solid fa-headset"></i> Students’ usage of AI tools are rooted in a demand for immediate technical support.

Common usage of AI tools include optimizing design workflows, generating initial code templates, and addressing technical questions related to clients’ tech stacks.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-comments"></i> Students experienced a smoother collaboration and workflow with AI integration.

AI tools served as a mediator or reference point for decision-making for teams who integrated AI tools into their workflow.

## Key Solutions

### <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Develop an AI-based curriculum for new client projects based on past successful client projects.

Suggest week-by-week instructions on how to tackle client needs and deliverables.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Create a centralized knowledge based for technical assistance, skill development, and program logistics.

Use AI to store in-house FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and tutorials to streamline learning curve and immediate guidance for students.

# Design Process

## Lo-Fi Wireframes

Kicking off the design process, I sketched out my vision for an AI platform tailored to DFG’s specific needs and use cases.

## User Journey

Building on these initial ideas, I developed a user journey outlining the experience of a student volunteer interacting with the AI platform. This step was critical, as it not only defined the user flow but also introduced a new set of feature concepts that served as key iteration points throughout the design process.

## Mid-Fi Wireframes

The next phase involved refining the product’s overall "look and feel" with input from developers and applying those refinements to the early mockups. To ensure we pursued the best possible options, we created multiple variations of the most important features for evaluation and feedback.

## Design Iterations

The mid-fidelity wireframes became a pivotal stage for design iterations. With the product’s visual framework in place, I collaborated extensively with Develop For Good’s management team and engineering mentors through partnerships with Stanford’s StartX and SahajAI. These discussions inspired new ideas for seamlessly integrating AI to enhance the impact student volunteers have on client deliverables.

# Final Work

## Student Dashboard

The student dashboard provides in-house resources for student volunteers to refer when assistance is needed and for all project-related tasks at Develop For Good.

## Edit Project Related Documents (PRD)

Every cycle, project teams are required to submit a Project Requirement Document (PRD) which lays out the expected deliverables for their respective nonprofit client at the end of the cycle. The PRD must be edited and submitted in their dashboard to generate the AI curriculum.

## Educational Curriculum

Upon PRD submission, students are provided an AI-based curriculum that displays task and next action suggestions for their project. If students are dissatisfied with the suggestion, they are free to modify the PRD with their team and resubmit the PRD for a modified AI curriculum. They can also ask questions to Pantheon’s in-house AI assistance PantheonAI for clarifying questions.

## PantheonAI

Students can reach out to DFG’s in-house AI assistant for all technical and logistical questions before reaching out to DFG management and product leads.

# Impact

## Outcome

As of October 2024, PantheonAI has officially been approved by Develop For Good's Board of Directors and Advisors, which includes tech luniaries like Kristen Swanson, Scott Forstall, and Mendal Rosenblum. With their endorsement, PantheonAI is expected to undergo further refinement and development!

## Next Steps

### <i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Refine Develop For Good's design system.

To support the expansion of Pantheon and PantheonAI, we're developing a unified design system to ensure visual consistency across all internal services built under Develop For Good.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass-chart"></i> Conduct further user and product research.

Since January 2024, Develop For Good has collaborated with organizations like Okta For Good, StartX, and SahajAI to explore the potential of AI within the organization. These partnerships have helped DFG strengthen their research efforts and ideate on innovative AI solutions. Moving forward, we plan to expand these collaborations and introduce cutting-edge AI products that will empower project deliverable success for thousands of students at DFG!
