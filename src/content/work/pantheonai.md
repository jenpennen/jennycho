# Context

## Background

[**Develop For Good (DFG)**](https://www.developforgood.org/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on closing the digital divide in the nonprofit sector and volunteerism. They offer opportunities for underserved and underrepresented college students to build real-world technical products for nonprofits.

## Problem Statement

> How can Develop For Good enhance the development experience of student volunteers by leveraging AI tools and resources?

During DFG's Winter 2024 cycle, founder Mary Zhu initiated conversations about integrating AI into the organization’s operations to address the growing demand for AI capabilities. This focus was driven by an unexpected trend in student volunteers' survey responses from the previous project cycle, Summer 2023: _more than half of the student volunteers reported using external AI sources for DFG-related tasks._

## My Work

To tackle this challenge, I focused on a critical area where AI was frequently applied: _project deliverable success._ As the lead product designer, I worked with DFG’s management team and stakeholders to explore solutions and address key AI challenges. I led the design strategy, guiding the process from user research and wireframing to delivering the first MVP for DFG's first AI interface.

# Research

## User Surveys

To better understand how students use AI, _I analyzed weekly check-in surveys from past and present project cycles._ This step had three goals: assess the extent of AI usage, identify potential correlations between AI use and project outcomes, and gain insights into the factors driving student reliance on AI. I also reached out to DFG’s nonprofit clients to gather feedback on project deliverables, overall satisfaction with DFG's programs, and their perspectives on AI usage, including whether they leverage AI within their own organizations.

## Survey Findings

### <i class="fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i> Over 70% of student volunteers reported using AI for DFG-related tasks for the Summer 2023 cycle.

Student volunteers reported using AI to aid their technical development needs to meet client deliverables.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-truck-ramp-box"></i> 81% of students reported that AI significantly contributed to successful project outcomes by the end of the cycle.

Students using AI tools reported using AI to build their problem-solving and technical skills through suggestions provided by AI.

## Further Insights

### <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-week"></i> Students’ usage of AI tools are rooted in a demand for immediate technical support.

With just 16 weeks to deliver an MVP within a single project cycle, _many students find it challenging to access timely support from Develop For Good’s product leads and mentors_, who are only available during limited hours. As a result, students often turn to AI tools to streamline their design/tech workflows, generate initial code templates, and resolve technical questions related to clients’ tech stacks.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-users-between-lines"></i> Students experienced a smoother collaboration and workflow with AI integration.

Both project teams with and without industry mentors reported leveraging AI tools to enhance their decision-making processes. _These AI tools served as mediators or reference points_, helping teams review critical aspects of their workflows before moving on to new tasks.

## My Approach

> Design an AI interface that serves as a centralized knowledge base for technical assistance and project-based curriculum for student volunteers.

At the end of each project cycle, Develop For Good updates its project database with new nonprofit client project scopes and case studies. _Integrating AI with DFG's existing data could enable the creation of in-house FAQs, tutorials, and project curricula based on past successful client projects._

# Process

## Understanding the Audience

The two primary end users of PantheonAI are student volunteers and nonprofit clients. Both groups work within cross-functional teams, and they share the same goals when faciliating discussions.

## Competitive Analysis

To better understand how other organizations integrate AI into their core services, I looked into existing platforms that provide technical skill development for both students and non-students, similar to DFG's mission.

## Vision Vs. Mission Map

Given what I knew from DFG's student surveys and competitive analysis for possible AI integrations, I explored the alignment between our organization's AI vision and mission to better guide my decision-making and design priorities. Clarifying this distinction between the overarching goals (vision) and the actionable steps (mission) helped me to make design choices that align with Pantheon's immediate and long-term objectives.

## Impact Effort Matrix

I worked alongside SahajAI engineers and DFG's management team to create an Impact Effort Matrix. Using this map, we organized feasible features and product ideas based on their expected impact and the effort required to implement them. From here, I was better able to prioritize design solutions that deliver the most value while optimizing resources within DFG and out.

## Bottlenecks/Opportunities

Before moving into prototyping, my team and I pinpointed potential bottlenecks and areas for growth to address pain points in our workflow and technical implementation. Tackling these challenges and opportunities early was essential for designing scalable features and components for Pantheon's AI interface.

## Low Fidelity Brainstorming

I sketched out my vision for an AI interface tailored to DFG’s specific needs and use cases. The purpose of this step was to brainstorm how to position PantheonAI as the primary resource for student help while also allowing the users the option to connect with product leads or technical mentors when needed.

## User Journey

Building on these ideas, I crafted a user journey outlining the experience of a student volunteer interacting with the AI feature. This step was critical, as it not only defined the user flow but also introduced a new set of feature concepts that served as key iteration points throughout the design process.

# Impact

## Outcome

As of October 2024, PantheonAI has officially been approved by Develop For Good's Board of Directors and Advisors, and it is expected to undergo development in 2025.

## Next Steps

### <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass-chart"></i> Conduct further user and product research.

Since January 2024, Develop For Good has collaborated with organizations like Okta For Good, StartX, and SahajAI to explore the potential of AI within the organization. These partnerships have helped DFG strengthen their research efforts and ideate on innovative AI solutions. Moving forward, we plan to expand these collaborations to introduce our own cutting-edge AI tool that will empower project deliverable success for thousands of students at DFG.
