# Context

## Background

Perspective is a club exploration platform developed and pitched at UCLA ACM's 2023 Hack of the Hill (HOTH) hackathon. I teamed with two dev-signers (Nastazia and Emily) and designer Emmy to address a common challenge faced by UCLA students: **_the lack of a convenient and informative way to explore clubs online_**. With Perspective, students can access real-time updates on club recruitment cycles, discover new organizations, and share club-related events and socials with their peers.

## Challenge

### Themes

The hackathon challenged each team to create a product that reflected the themes of **_education, environmentalism, and intersectionality_**. Guided by these themes, my team and I brainstormed a variety of ideas, ranging from games to mobile apps.

### Product Ideation

We found ourselves reminiscing our early experiences as UCLA freshmen during the coronavirus lockdown. **We shared a common struggle: finding and fostering a sense of community at UCLA was incredibly challenging**. With most social interactions limited to course group chats on GroupMe, it was hard to feel connected both socially and academically in a virtual environment. **This shared experience solidified our decision to focus our product on _education and intersectionality_**.

# Research

## Problems

### Students discover new clubs primarily through word of mouth.

The most common way for students to discover new clubs at UCLA is through the infamous Enormous Activities Fair (EAF), with word of mouth being another primary method. Although there is an official clubs directory page on UCLA's website, there is currently no effective way for students to research new clubs online.

### Keeping track of club-specific social events is challenging.

Most UCLA clubs share their social event updates on platforms like Instagram. However, staying informed can be difficult for students who aren’t already members.

## Goals

### Expand year-round social outreach.

Relying solely on in-person events and social media for outreach makes it easy for clubs to go unnoticed. It’s time to broaden efforts and actively share all social events with the entire UCLA community year-round.

### Create a student-led movement to provide comprehensive club information oneline.

Prospective members want to know more than just a club’s mission and objectives— **_they need actionable details_**. Provide them with essential resources like QR codes, recruitment timelines, and connections to club representatives to encourage them to join and engage.

# Design Process

## First Iteration

With only 12 hours to create a functional MVP, my team and I sped through the design process to jumpstart our development. Regardless, we wanted to abide to the best design practices possible.

### Style Guide

We quickly drafted a color guide, using shades of orange and blue to emphasize new events.

### Low-Fi Wireframes

I sketched out our product concept by hand, with community building as the core feature.

### Hi-Fi Wireframes

Next, we created high-fidelity wireframes to kickstart the development process.

## Second Iteration

Following the end of the hackathon, I continued refining Perspective with teammate Nastazia Coronado with hopes to deploy and share with the UCLA community. Without the 12-hour time limit, we immediately went back to hand sketches with new features.
