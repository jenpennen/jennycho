# Context

## Background

Develop For Good (DFG) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides underserved and underrepresented college students with technical opportunities through real-world nonprofit client projects. Founded in March 2020 by Stanford students Mary Zhu and Amay Aggarwal, DFG was established to support nonprofits struggling with digital access during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide opportunities for students to engage in meaningful tech-focused volunteer work.

## My Work

I joined Develop For Good as a software engineer in March 2023. Alongside fellow engineer Anish Sinha, we identified a critical need for a dedicated cloud infrastructure to support DFG’s growing demand among students and nonprofits. In August 2023, we proposed a series of Cloud and AI initiatives to DFG Founder Mary Zhu, which ultimately led to the creation of Pantheon. As a founding designer and engineer, I spearheaded the design strategy and frontend engineering for DFG’s internal services, and continue to work on Pantheon to this date.

## Observation

### Develop For Good operates in four month project cycles twice a year.

Volunteers are placed in teams focusing on technical projects in web/mobile development, data engineering, and UI/UX design, with each team consisting of at least 8 volunteers.

### An increasing number of students and nonprofits are turning to DFG for technical opportunities and services.

More and more students and nonprofits apply to DFG per project cycle. Despite this rising demand, DFG can currently support around 35 nonprofit clients per cycle.
