  intro: "I'm a ux/product designer currently working on internal tools at Develop For Good.",
  background: "I was drawn to design through my engineering projects at UCLA. I would constantly ask myself: how can I blend my technical skills with design to engineer authentic and nostalgic experiences in a digital world?",
  mission: "My engineering background plays an integral role in my design workflow and vice versa. Whether in my professional work or side projects, I strive to combine clean design principles with thoughtful engineering to make online interactions seamless, natural, and enjoyable.",
