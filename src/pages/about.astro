  intro: "Hello! My name is Jenny. I specialize in UX design and frontend engineering.",
  background: "I was drawn to design through my engineering projects at UCLA. I was fascinated by how design shapes our interactions with technology. It inspired me to explore how design and technology work together to craft innovative and user-focused solutions. I often ask myself: how can I blend design and tech to create authentic and nostalgic experiences in a digital world?",
  mission: "As a user-centered engineer, I strive to combine clean design principles with thoughtful engineering to make online interactions seamless, natural, and enjoyable.",
